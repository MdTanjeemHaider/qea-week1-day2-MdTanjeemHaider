number_guess.py - Day 2 exercise, Part 2: the number-guessing game.

Read first: "Break and Continue Statements" (section 2.5, the guessing-game
skeleton), "Loops: for and while", "Conditional Statements: if, elif, else",
"Input and Output Operations".

HOW TO RUN (play it yourself)
    python3 number_guess.py          (Windows: python number_guess.py)

HOW THE SELF-CHECK TESTS IT (no typing needed)
    check_exercise.py makes a temporary copy of this file, changes the two
    constants below (SECRET_NUMBER and MAX_ATTEMPTS), feeds it a scripted list
    of guesses and reads what it prints. So:
      - keep the constant names SECRET_NUMBER and MAX_ATTEMPTS, each on its own line
      - print the messages EXACTLY as the README specifies
"""

# ---- Settings (provided; do not rename) ------------------------------------
SECRET_NUMBER = 42      # fixed on purpose so the game can be tested
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 7        # a guess that counts uses up one attempt
MIN_NUMBER = 1
MAX_NUMBER = 100

# ---- State (provided) -------------------------------------------------------
attempts = 0            # how many VALID guesses so far
result = "NONE"         # must end as "WIN", "LOSE" or "QUIT"

print(f"Guess the number between {MIN_NUMBER} and {MAX_NUMBER}. "
      f"You have {MAX_ATTEMPTS} attempts. Type q to quit.")

while True:
    answer = input("Guess (1-100): ").strip()

    if answer.lower() == "q":
        print(f'You quit. The number was {SECRET_NUMBER}.')
        result = "QUIT"
        break

    if not answer.isdigit():
        print("Invalid input: please type a whole number.")
        continue

    answer = int(answer)

    if answer < MIN_NUMBER or answer > MAX_NUMBER:
        print("Out of range: choose a number from 1 to 100.")
        continue

    attempts += 1

    if answer > SECRET_NUMBER:
        print("Too High")
    elif answer < SECRET_NUMBER:
        print("Too Low")
    else:
        print(f'Correct! You needed {attempts} attempts.')
        result = "WIN"
        break

        print(f'Out of attempts! The number was {SECRET_NUMBER}.')
